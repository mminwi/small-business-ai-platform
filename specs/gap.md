2. Gaps vs your module list (by category)
You already cover CRM, projects, scheduling/dispatch, invoicing, basic integrations, inventory/BOM, work orders, quality, help desk, gov‑specific modules, website/landing pages, and AI.

Below are categories that recur across platforms and are not (or only weakly) present in your list.

A. Human Resources / Employee Management
Present as: Zoho People, Zoho Payroll, employee records; Gusto/QuickBooks Time add‑ons; ServiceTitan payroll/HR‑adjacent; third‑party HR for many stacks.

Your list: no HR core (employee master data, onboarding, PTO tracking, basic policies).

B. Payroll
Native or tightly coupled: QuickBooks Payroll and integrations (e.g., Gusto), Zoho Payroll, ServiceTitan payroll module.

Your list: only “QuickBooks Online API Integration”; no payroll or explicit integration pattern (e.g., pre‑built Gusto, QuickBooks Payroll, ADP).

C. Time tracking / timesheets
Core for: QuickBooks Time, Gusto, Monday time tracking, multiple time‑tracking tools; ServiceTitan/Jobber implicitly log tech time and job duration.

Your list: job tracking and scheduling, but no explicit timesheets/time‑against‑job with approval.

D. Purchase Orders / purchasing
Standard in SAP Business One purchasing & POs, Zoho Books/Inventory purchasing, ServiceTitan payables/AP.

Your list: “Supplier & Vendor Management” and inventory, but nothing explicitly about POs, goods receipts, AP workflow.

E. Asset / equipment management (company assets)
Platforms: SAP B1 fixed assets; ServiceTitan equipment management (customer equipment), Zoho fixed assets via Books and often separate asset tools.

Your list: “Inventory & Parts” and “Work Orders” but no dedicated module for tracking company tools, vehicles, calibration assets, or customer‑site equipment with maintenance schedules (separate from job).

F. Reporting & analytics / dashboards
Strong theme: SAP reporting/BI, QuickBooks dashboards and BI, Zoho Analytics, ServiceTitan reporting/dashboards, Monday dashboards, HubSpot analytics.

Your list: no explicit cross‑module analytics/BI layer beyond implied operational views.

G. Marketing / email campaigns
Built‑in: HubSpot marketing/email automation, Zoho Campaigns/marketing suite, ServiceTitan marketing/lead attribution, Jobber basic follow‑ups and quote reminders.

Your list: “Basic Website & Landing Page Generation”, “Customer Chat / AI Help Desk”, but nothing about outbound email campaigns, nurture sequences, SMS marketing, or ad/attribution tracking.

H. E‑commerce / online ordering
Zoho Commerce for online ordering and inventory; QuickBooks connects sales channels; some service platforms provide online estimate/booking, but full storefront usually separate.

Your list: website/landing pages but no carts, product catalog, or order capture/payments for self‑serve e‑commerce.

I. Field service mobile app specifics
ServiceTitan and Jobber center on mobile technician apps: GPS, route optimization, on‑site photos, signatures, checklists, offline support, on‑site estimates & payments, customer notifications.

Your list: “Scheduling & Dispatch” and “Work Orders & Job Tracking,” but nothing explicit about a mobile tech app and its feature set.

J. Appointment/online booking
Present in Jobber (requests, client hub), ServiceTitan (online booking), Zoho Bookings, QuickBooks customer hub appointment scheduling.

Your list: scheduling/dispatch but not self‑service online booking or booking widgets.

K. Subscriptions / recurring contracts
ServiceTitan memberships, Zoho Billing/subscriptions, many CRMs handle retainers or recurring deals.

Your list: no explicit contract/membership/recurring‑service module beyond ordinary projects/jobs.

3. Assessment of each gap
1) Human Resources / employee management
How common: Very common to handle via separate HR/benefits tools; fully integrated HR suite appears mainly in broader suites like Zoho One and via integrations (Gusto + QuickBooks).

Who needs it most:

Small service: light needs (employee records, certifications, simple PTO).

Small manufacturers: more important for training records, certifications, shift assignment.

Gov contractors: important if you want to tie training/clearances to ISO/ITAR/contract compliance.

Standalone vs built‑in: Frequently handled by standalone HR/Payroll tools (Gusto, BambooHR, Rippling) that integrate with accounting rather than embedded in operations.

2) Payroll
How common: Accounting‑centric stacks (QuickBooks, Zoho Books) either ship payroll modules or tightly integrate with Gusto/QuickBooks Payroll; field‑service ERPs like ServiceTitan often include payroll exports.

Who needs it most:

All three segments need payroll, but they tolerate a separate system as long as GL and time data integrate well.

Gov contractors may require cost‑plus, labor classification, and DCAA‑friendly reporting, which almost always lives in specialized payroll/time systems.

Standalone vs built‑in: Commonly standalone (Gusto, QuickBooks Payroll, ADP, Paychex) with integrations; “nice‑to‑have” inside your platform as pre‑built integrations, not as a full payroll engine.

3) Time tracking / timesheets
How common: Extremely common as a feature or integration: Monday, QuickBooks Time, Gusto, ServiceTitan, Jobber all have some notion of tracked time or job hours.

Who needs it most:

Small service: essential for job costing, payroll, and tech utilization.

Small manufacturers: line‑level time against work orders is very useful but sometimes handled on the shop floor separately.

Gov contractors: essential if you ever touch cost‑reimbursable or T&M contracts.

Standalone vs built‑in: Often standalone (QuickBooks Time, Harvest, Clockify, etc.) but many platforms embed light timesheets; embedding at least “time against job/project” plus export is close to essential.

4) Purchase orders & purchasing workflows
How common: Standard in SAP B1, Zoho Books/Inventory, and often present as AP/payables in field‑service ERPs.

Who needs it most:

Small service: useful when purchasing equipment or subcontractor services, but can be light.

Small manufacturers: essential for supplier control, ISO, and inventory accuracy.

Gov contractors: often required for traceability of direct costs.

Standalone vs built‑in: Usually built in as part of inventory/AP; not typically outsourced to a separate app at this scale.

5) Asset / equipment management
How common: Present in SAP (fixed assets), ServiceTitan (equipment management), Zoho via Books or separate asset tools; often a distinct module when asset lifecycle matters.

Who needs it most:

Small service: tracking customer equipment + your own trucks, tools; often essential for HVAC, mechanical, etc.

Small manufacturers: calibration equipment, machines, PM schedules; important and often linked to ISO 9001.

Gov contractors: can be important for government‑furnished equipment and ITAR‑controlled hardware.

Standalone vs built‑in: Sometimes standalone CMMS/EAM, but many field‑service and ERP products have enough built‑in; at your size, even a simple “Assets” module tightly linked to work orders is high‑value.

6) Reporting & analytics / dashboards
How common: Universal; every platform above emphasizes dashboards and cross‑module analytics.

Who needs it most:

All segments: essential (even 5‑person shops want a “control tower” for jobs, cash, pipeline, and compliance status).

Standalone vs built‑in: Often built‑in, with optional export to BI tools; you should have a first‑class reporting/analytics layer, potentially powered by your AI layer.

7) Marketing / email campaigns
How common: Central to HubSpot and Zoho; ServiceTitan and Jobber bake in campaign and follow‑up tools; QuickBooks and Monday rely more on integrations.

Who needs it most:

Small service: very important for keeping the phone ringing (remarketing to existing customers, maintenance reminders).

Small manufacturers: useful but often lower sophistication; may rely on a standalone marketing platform.

Gov contractors: lower priority; BD often revolves around networking, teaming, bids—email campaigns help but are not core operations.

Standalone vs built‑in: Frequently standalone (Mailchimp, HubSpot, Constant Contact) even when CRM exists; having simple campaigns + native integrations is a strong nice‑to‑have.

8) E‑commerce / online ordering
How common: Strong in Zoho Commerce and in many accounting systems via “connect sales channels”; less central in service‑centric tools, which focus on booking rather than carts.

Who needs it most:

Small service: online ordering is less critical; online booking is more important.

Small manufacturers: e‑commerce becomes important if they sell standardized products or spares, otherwise often postponed.

Gov contractors: generally low relevance (orders go via procurement systems, not web shops).

Standalone vs built‑in: Commonly standalone (Shopify, WooCommerce) plus accounting integration; your platform can target lightweight quoting/ordering rather than full commerce engine.

9) Field service mobile app features
How common: Core differentiator for Jobber and ServiceTitan: GPS, routing, on‑site quotes/invoices, photo capture, forms, signatures, offline.

Who needs it most:

Small service: essential for any field‑heavy trade.

Small manufacturers: useful if they also do field install or service.

Gov contractors: important only for deployed field teams.

Standalone vs built‑in: Almost always built into the operational platform; generic field‑data‑capture tools exist, but the value is in tight linkage to work orders and billing.

10) Appointment / online booking
How common: Jobber and ServiceTitan (web requests, online booking), Zoho Bookings, QuickBooks customer scheduling.

Who needs it most:

Small service: increasingly expected by customers.

Small manufacturers: occasionally for demos/consults, but not core.

Gov contractors: largely irrelevant.

Standalone vs built‑in: Often lightweight built‑in or handled by Calendly‑style tools; easy win to tie to your scheduling and CRM.

11) Subscriptions / recurring contracts
How common: Present in ServiceTitan memberships and Zoho Billing/subscriptions; many CRMs approximate via recurring deals.

Who needs it most:

Small service: strong value for maintenance contracts, service plans.

Small manufacturers: relevant if they sell service plans or SaaS components.

Gov contractors: relevant mainly for multi‑year service contracts with recurring billing milestones.

Standalone vs built‑in: Sometimes standalone (Chargebee, Stripe Billing) but often part of billing in vertical tools; a simple “contracts/memberships” module tied to invoicing is a useful differentiator.

4. Summary gap table
Interpret “How Common” as: Essential (seen or expected almost everywhere), Common (frequent, strong expectation in some segments), Nice‑to‑have.

Gap / Module	How Common for SMB Software	Which Customer Type Needs It Most	Standalone Tool Typically Used?
Human Resources / Employee records	Common	Manufacturers; gov contractors; service firms with more staff	Yes (Gusto HR, BambooHR, etc.)
Payroll	Essential (but integrable)	All segments; stricter needs for gov contractors	Yes (Gusto, QuickBooks Payroll, ADP)
Time tracking / timesheets	Essential for services/gov	Service firms; gov contractors; helpful for manufacturers	Yes (QuickBooks Time, Harvest, My Hours)
Purchase orders & purchasing	Essential for manufacturers	Manufacturers; useful for service and gov contractors	Usually built‑in to ERP/Inventory
Asset / equipment management	Common	Field‑service trades; manufacturers; some gov contractors	Sometimes (CMMS/EAM) but often built‑in
Cross‑module reporting & dashboards	Essential	All segments (financial + operational cockpit)	External BI possible, but in‑app dashboards expected
Marketing / email campaigns	Common	Service firms and manufacturers doing outbound marketing	Yes (HubSpot, Mailchimp, Zoho Campaigns)
E‑commerce / online ordering	Nice‑to‑have / niche	Product‑oriented manufacturers; some service firms selling parts	Yes (Shopify, WooCommerce, Zoho Commerce)
Field tech mobile app	Essential for field trades	Service firms with field technicians	Typically built‑in to FSM (Jobber, ServiceTitan)
Appointment / online booking	Common for services	Service firms (home services, consults); mild for others	Yes (Calendly, Zoho Bookings, etc.)
Subscriptions / recurring contracts	Common in some verticals	Service firms with maintenance plans; some manufacturers	Yes (Stripe Billing, Chargebee, Zoho Billing)
If you want to prioritize for your audience, I’d treat as near‑term roadmap candidates:

Time tracking/timesheets, PO/purchasing, reporting/dashboards, and a field‑tech‑oriented mobile app and online booking for service‑heavy customers.

Asset/equipment management and simple HR/employee records tightly linked to ISO and job roles for manufacturers/gov contractors.
